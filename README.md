![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alblubertarian/Lio_dotfiles/master/screen1.png)

## Programs used:

- Bar: Tint2
- Openbox Theme: [Slightly altered Pelangi theme from addy-dclxvi](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/openbox-theme-collections)
- Shell: Fish
- Text Editor: NeoVim
- File Manager: Ranger
- Notification Daemon: Dunst
- Music Programs: MPD with NCMPCPP
- Image viewer: Feh(and WP Handler)
- Launcher: Rofi
- Terminal: URxvt


## To-do stuff I want to do:

- [ ] Polish most of the dotfiles(remove unneeded lines & such)
- [ ] Make dotfiles restorable quickly for me and anyone who wants to clone them
- [ ] Find a decent icon theme


## Misc stuff

- I rarely use GUI apps on this setup so I just use Arc as my GTK theme, thus I haven't included that in the section before
- Wallpapers are(of course) not mine, the author's called Tamaki and you can find their illustrations on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tamaki599)
